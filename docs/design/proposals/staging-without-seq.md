# Proposal: staging without `_seq`

Status: **Draft** · Drafted 2026-09-02

Every staging table carries a `_seq`, and every read folds on it. Make each edit replace the rows it names — delete then insert — and the column goes from all four kinds, along with the four folds that read it. A staging table then *is* what the layer will write, and reading one is a table scan.

## What starts it

[Staging](../working-record.md#staging) holds the rule this proposal finishes: **every table is shaped like the file it becomes.** No table satisfies it, because every one carries a `_seq` no file has, and three of the four need a fold to mean anything.

`_seq` serves four purposes, and they are not the same problem:

| kind | what `_seq` does | folded by |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| axis | orders two **partial** rows for one label | `_collapsed_axis` |
| entity axis | orders two whole rows for one name | `_collapsed_entities` |
| `inputs`/`outputs` | orders two rows for one coordinate | `_collapsed_inputs` |
| groups | orders two rows for one `group_key` | `_collapsed_group` |
| — | `_CARRIED_SEQ`: marks a row a **fill**, not an edit | (see below) |

The last is a different thing wearing the same column, and it is the one that decides whether `_seq` can go entirely.

## The construct

**An edit replaces the rows it names.** Delete the keys, insert the new rows:

```sql
DELETE FROM <table> WHERE <key> IN (SELECT <key> FROM _rows);
INSERT INTO <table> BY NAME SELECT * FROM _rows;
```

`_rows` is the arrow relation `_values_relation` builds, registered by replacement scan — the same crossing every insert here already makes, and the same `DELETE`-by-scan `_release_from_other_types` uses. Nothing becomes Python objects per row, which rules out `INSERT … VALUES`.

The key is per kind, and in each case it is the one the fold already partitions on: the label for an axis, `entity` for the entity axis, the coordinate set for a long file, `group_key` for a group. So the delete removes exactly what `_latest_per` would have discarded.

### Axis rows must also become complete

Delete-then-insert alone is not enough for an axis, because there the *rows* are partial, not merely duplicated. One `set` stages a row carrying that attribute's column and NULL for its siblings; replacing the row would clear them.

So a `set` on an axis attribute stages **the complete row for each label it touches**: the previously staged row where one exists, otherwise the base's, with this edit's column replaced. Where a label has no base row, the staged columns are the whole of it, as today.

The base read is already there — `_stage_axis`'s scalar arm reads `self._base.dims.axes.get(dim)` to know which labels exist. The mapping arm would start, as a point lookup against a folded relation the `NodeCache` already holds.

That is what retires `_collapsed_axis`'s `max_by(a, _seq) FILTER (WHERE a IS NOT NULL)` — the `FILTER` stops a sibling's NULL from winning, and the `max_by` makes two `set`s commute. With rows complete, both are what the table already holds.

Downstream of it, `_axis_frame`'s outer join and per-column `coalesce` go — they exist to fill an untouched label that would otherwise read as cleared — and `_axis_layer`'s semi-join for a [`partial`](../schema.md#partial-the-granularity-of-an-override) dim goes with them: with only touched labels present and rows complete, **the table's rows are the touch record.**

### `_CARRIED_SEQ`'s job is already done by an anti-join

`_complete_owned_whole` copies base rows into a long staging table so the layer carries an extent it now [owns whole](../schema.md#partial-the-granularity-of-an-override). Those rows are fills, and a real edit on the same coordinate must beat one regardless of arrival order — which is what `_CARRIED_SEQ = 0`, below every edit's, expresses.

It never fires. The method's third anti-join drops any coordinate the table already holds, and its key set is the one `_collapsed_inputs` partitions on, so a fill and an edit cannot coexist on one coordinate. Checked against the fixture's three attribute shapes — no `owned_whole` dims, one, and one with breakpoints — the anti-join's `[*scope, *present, "breakpoint"]` and the partition's `input_key ∪ dims ∪ {breakpoint}`, both intersected with the file's columns, are the same set every time.

So the priority class is redundant: the anti-join keeps fills out of occupied coordinates, and under this proposal a later `set` on a filled coordinate deletes the fill before inserting. Two mechanisms, one of which was already sufficient.

**Worth being exact about the residual risk.** The two key sets *agree* rather than being *derived from one place* — `_complete_owned_whole` builds `[*scope, *present, "breakpoint"]` and `_collapsed_inputs` builds its own. They match today for every shape the suite exercises, and a schema where they diverge would already be a bug (a fill surviving beside an edit, resolved only by `_CARRIED_SEQ`). Landing this should make them one derivation rather than two that agree, which is a small refactor and the honest way to retire the guard.

### The entity axis joins, and the two collapse modes go with it

`dims/entity.parquet` has a single-label key and its columns are [one indivisible fact](../format.md#the-entity-axis) — a name exists, is of this type, is alive or dead. Delete-then-insert on `entity` gives `remove` then `add` under another type one row by construction, where `_collapsed_entities` folds whole-row to get the same answer today.

That retires the last place staging folds differently depending on what it is folding. `_collapsed_axis` folds per column and `_collapsed_entities` per row, and the difference is real: an axis row's columns are independently editable, a membership row's are not. Under this proposal neither folds, so the distinction stops being a branch and becomes what it always was — a fact about the data.

It does change `remove`, from "append a tombstone" to "replace the row with a tombstone". The semantics are the same because membership is one fact per name, but staging is no longer append-only.

## The alternative to re-evaluate

**`INSERT … SELECT … ON CONFLICT (<key>) DO UPDATE SET`** is the same idea in one statement, and DuckDB supports it on the arrow-relation form, so the column-wise insert path survives either way.

Two reasons it is not the proposal:

- **It needs a primary key on the staging table.** Tables are created from a relation by `_shape(...).create(name)`, which carries no constraint, so this would mean DDL after create — a second step back for exactly the tables that rule was introduced to make uniform.
- **`DO UPDATE SET` needs its column list built per call**, where delete-then-insert is the same two statements whatever the edit names.

Neither is fatal, and a true upsert is one statement rather than two. **Re-evaluate once the shape here is settled** — if the delete-then-insert version lands cleanly, the question is only whether `_shape` can carry a key without giving up being the single source of a table's shape.

## What this buys

**Four folds go**, and with them `_latest_per` itself: `_collapsed_axis`, `_collapsed_entities`, `_collapsed_inputs`, `_collapsed_group` become the tables they read. The tombstone anti-join in `_collapsed_inputs` stays — a component tombstone reaching another attribute's rows is a cross-table fact, not an ordering one.

**Reads become table scans.** `_axis_layer` runs per axis on every commit and every staged read; today each call is an aggregate, an outer join, a per-column `coalesce` and possibly a semi-join. The work moves to one base lookup per `set`, paid once.

**The staging rule holds all the way.** "Shaped like the file it becomes" currently means columns; after this it means rows too, and a staged table can be handed to `write_record` without a fold in between. `StagedSource` becomes projection-free — its members return tables.

## What it costs

**A `set` reads the base, for axes.** The mapping arm gains a point lookup. Against it: the scalar arm already does this, and the relation is one the `NodeCache` holds.

**Append-only goes.** Staging becomes read-modify-write, so an edit is no longer a pure append. That is what makes a row complete and a key unique — but a reader who assumes "staged rows accumulate" will be wrong.

**Two statements per edit where there was one.** Both are scans over the same registered relation, and edits are not the hot path; the reads are.

**A carried row's protection becomes structural rather than belt-and-braces.** Today the anti-join and `_CARRIED_SEQ` both keep a fill from beating an edit. After, only the anti-join does — see the residual risk above.

## How to know it worked

**`_seq` is absent from every staging table.** The single assertion the whole proposal is downstream of: a `_shape` still declaring it means something still orders rows.

**Two `set` calls on one axis still commute**, which is what the `FILTER` bought. Existing coverage should pass unchanged — if `set("icon", …)` then `set("budget", …)` on one label loses the icon, the row was not complete.

**A `partial` dim's layer carries the touched labels and no others.** `test_a_partial_axis_stays_a_patch` pins this from the outside; it says the semi-join was subsumed rather than dropped.

**A `remove` then `add` under another type is one row** — `test_a_freed_name_may_be_reclaimed_by_another_type`, now by construction.

**A whole-owned extent still carries its untouched coordinates after two edits.** `_complete_owned_whole`'s idempotence is what this leans on hardest, so the case to pin is a second `set` on the same attribute at a different coordinate: the first edit's fills must survive, and the second's must replace the fill on its own coordinate.
